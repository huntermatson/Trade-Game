You and your customer have settled on a price but now you need to agree on a contract which will cover the terms and responsibilities of each party.

International Commerical Terms (Incoterms) are a set of internationally-recognized rules which define the responsibilities of sellers and buyers in an export transFinancial Instrument. The Incoterms that you have agreed with your buyer(s) is Delivered Duty Paid (DDP). 

Under the DDP Incoterms, the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs for delivering the goods to the named place of destination. The seller must pay both export and import formalities, fees, duties and taxes.

Given that you, the seller, will assume the financial liability until the $Product reaches the buyer, you must decide which type of financial instrument to use.

Which financial instrument do you want to use?

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Customs Option]\
For the customs option, you selected: (if:$Customs is "Training")[(text-colour:red)[''Undertake training on customs and border procedures.'']
](if:$Customs is "Broker")[(text-colour:red)[''Hire a customers broker to handle customs procedures.
'']](if:$Customs is "Research")[(text-colour:red)[''Independently research customs and border procedures on the internet.''
]]\

Undertaking training on customs and border procedures is a good decision as it can help you navigate the complexities of international trade and its required documents.

Hiring a customs broker to handle customs procedures is a good decision because it can save time, reduce risk of errors, and ensure compliance with regulations.

Conducting independent research can be a cost-effective method for finding information about customs procedures. However, the procedure can be complicated without any help. While there is no harm in selecting this option, you alone are responsible for demonstrating customs compliance.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Voluntary Standards]\
For the voluntary sustainability standards option, you selected: (if:$Standards is "Implement")[(text-colour:red)[''Research and implement voluntary sustainability standards.'']
](if:$Standards is "Packaging")[(text-colour:red)[''Package your product in 100% recycled materials.
'']](if:$Standards is "NoStandard")[(text-colour:red)[''Not implement voluntary standards.''
]]\

Implementing voluntary sustainability standards is a good choice since it can provide access to new markets, increase export opportunities, and enhance competitiveness.

Packaging your product in recycled materials may or may not increase profits. The effectiveness depends on the level of demand in the destination market and the extent to which it has adopted sustainable practices.

Not implementing voluntary standards will not stop you from exporting, but your products may have less market competitiveness in certain countries.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Business Registration]\
For the business registration option, you selected: (if:$Registration is "Local")[(text-colour:red)[''Register with a national government.'']
](if:$Registration is "NoRegistration")[(text-colour:red)[''Do not register with any organization.''
]](if:$Registration is "LEI")[(text-colour:red)[''Obtain a global business registration.'']]\

Registering your business with a national government is a good option. It allows you to obtain the necessary licenses and permits required and provides certain legal assurances for your business.

Obtaining a global business registration is a good option. You can gain international recognition and credibility with investors, customers, and other stakeholders that need Legal Entity Identifer (LEI) data to optimize business procedures for market transactions.

Not registering your business can have several disadvantages, such as legal penalties, difficulties in obtaining loans and credit, limitations on business activities, and lack of credibility with customers and suppliers.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Marketing]\
For the marketing option, you selected: (if:$Marketing is "TPA")[(text-colour:red)[''Contact your trade promotion agency.'']
](if:$Marketing is "Website")[(text-colour:red)[''Create your own website.
'']](if:$Marketing is "eCommerce")[(text-colour:red)[''Join an eCommerce marketplace.''
]]\

All three marketing options are good options, however the optimal option depends on your specific circumstances.

Trade promotion agencies often have representatives in-country and can provide in-depth knowledge of the local market and import procedures that may not be available through other sources. 

E-commerce platforms can increase online sales by finding customers in markets you had not originally intended to market to.  However, some e-commerce platforms charge high commission fees to sellers to use the platform.

A well-designed business website can attract potential customers and provide them with important information such as product features, pricing, and shipping information. However, setting up a useable website requires technical skills, including optimizing your website so that it appears in search results and can be found by potential customers.

You're  just about ready to begin exporting.

First, you must determine whether you have sufficient funds to complete your export or if you'd like to try and raise more capital now.

Note that if you are successful in obtaining a loan, you'll have to pay an originating fee of 5% of the loan as well as repay the loan after you deliver your $Product to the customer. The interest rate of the loan is $InterestRate%.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Should I register my business?]\

Ideas turn into businesses every day. Initially, many of these businesses are unregistered, meaning that they operate informally and therefore have not gained formal recognition from a government authority or internationally recognized organization. At some point, many businesses opt to seek formal registration as it provides comprehensive legal recognition and protection for your business.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Here are the options you have for business registration:]\

''Global registration :'' Normally choosing a global registration means getting a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). An LEI is a 20-character, alphanumeric code that provides a clear and unique identification to businesses and other entities participating in financial transactions.  Although an LEI is not a legal requirement, there are several benefits that your business can get from an LEI. You can gain international recognition and credibility with investors, customers, and other stakeholders.

''National registration :'' Registering your business with a national government allows you to obtain the necessary licenses and permits required for your specific industry, and makes it easier to access government services and support. 

''No registration :'' Although it is not a legal requirement to register your business, opting not to do so can have several disadvantages. Some examples include legal penalties, difficulties in obtaining loans and credit, limitations on business activities, and lack of credibility with customers and suppliers.

NOTE: If you are exporting to Sarvarhara, registration is a must!

:: Help Conveyance [Help] {"position":"1225,1050","size":"100,100"}
(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[How to choose a shipping method?]\

Choosing a shipping method for international trade involves considering several factors such as cost, speed, reliability, security, and the nature of the product.

Some common methods of transportation include sea freight, air freight, overland transport. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific requirements of the trade.

''Sea freight:'' Maritime transport is how the majority of goods are shipped around the world. There are many options for sea freight, including booking a container on a regular shipping line or chartering a vessel for a specific type of freight.  The cost of sea freight is usually based on characteristics of the goods, such as how much they weigh, and their volume as well as the distance to the final destination. Besides the cost of the freight, traders need to be aware of potential port charges, terminal charges, or variable factors such fuel costs or currency conversions, as these can increase costs. 

''Overland transport:'' Overland transport is a very flexible mode of shipping products. Shipping containers can be directly offloaded onto trucks or railbeds, which can then bring the cargo to its destination. For short- and medium-distance hauls, overland transport is significantly less expensive than air freight yet has competitive shippings times. However, on longer distances overland transport can become more expensive and laws may prohibit freight trucks and railcars from crossing borders. Differences in weight limit restrictions, road conditions, and rail guage sizes may inhibit cross-border overland transport. Importantly, this shipping method is dependent upon sufficient infrastructure, including road and rail networks, and may be impacted by conflict and polical instablilty.

''Air freight:'' The shipment of goods by aircraft is the fastest but also the most expensive form of transportation. Air freight can make sense for small high-value shipment or those which are perishable or time-sensitive.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Below is a description of the infrastructure conditions in your available import and export locations:]

* ''Kujuma:'' Overland transport is not advisable for imports to or exports from Kujuma becuase of insufficient local infrastructure. There is a sea port and multiple airports available for transportation.
* ''Sarvahara:'' Sarvahara has a well-developed road and rail network, as well as several seaports and airports throughout the country.  All conveyance methods are available when importing to or exporting from Sarvahara.
* ''Luminaria:''  Luminaria has a well-developed road and rail network, as well as several seaports and airports throughout the country.  All conveyance methods are available when importing to or exporting from Luminaria.

A good source to learn more about this topic is the '' <a href="https://learning.intracen.org/course/info.php?id=277" target="_blank"> ITC Introduction to International Transport and Logistics</a>''  online course. This course teaches users the basic transport and logistical requirements of export operations, including cross-border sea freight, air freight and packaging procedures.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[How do I select a country to export from?]\
You may consider some of the following factors when choosing your country of export:
0. ''Geo-economic factors:'' Consider the location, level of development, and political aspects of the economy.
0. ''Business environment: ''Evaluate the business environment of the country you are considering. Think about factors such as ease of doing business and legal frameworks.
0. ''Domestic requirements and trade policies: ''Evaluate the trade policies, taxes, tariffs, and import/export regulations that can affect your business.
0. ''Logistics: ''Assess the logistics. Consider factors such as transportation costs, infrastructure, and proximity to your production facilities.
0. ''Production capacity: ''Think about your ability to produce the product in sufficient quantities and at a competitive price. Consider the availability of raw materials, production costs, and production technology.
(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Here is a brief summary of each of your export country options:]\
* ''Kujuma'' is categorized as a least developed country (LDC), with an average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of about $700 per year. As an exporter from Kujuma, you would begin your journey with $100. Although the initial endowment in Kujuma is relatively low, the exporting process is also less costly, and a successful export could be quite profitable. However, accessing financing could be challenging as the banking sector is not as developed, resulting in a high interest rate of 14%.
* ''Sarvahara'' is categorized as a developing country, with an average GDP per capita of about $3,700 per year. It has a large and young population and is quickly moving up the global value chain. As an exporter from Sarvahara, you would begin your journey with $500. The exporting cost is higher than Kujuma but lower than Luminaria. The financial environment is moderately freindly to new and growing businesses within the country, and has a loan interest rate of 6%.
* ''Luminaria'' is categorized as a developed country, with an average GDP per capita of about $38,000 per year. It is wealthy and has a well-established financial system with a low loan interest rate of 3%. As an exporter from Luminaria, you would begin your journey with $5,000. It is relatively expensive to export from the country, with high costs for things such as purchasing insurance and transportation.

Once your goods have arrived in the destination country, you have a few options to get your goods the final mile to your customer. 

If your goods are time-sensitive or require specialized handling, such as refrigeration or hazardous materials, then an international courier service may be a good, but expensive, option.

If your goods are not time-sensitive or require specialized handling, domestic courier services are usually more familiar with the local regulations and may be more adept at navigating the delivery in the destination country. Furthermore, domestic couriers tend to be more economical than their international counterparts.

''Hire a customs broker :'' Customs brokers and clearing agents are specialists on customs rules and procedures. They can help ensure import documents are correct and may assist with forwarding arrangements.  In some economies, it is compulsory when an import value is above a certain threshold to use a licensed customs agent to clear goods through customs. In others, businesses simply choose to hire a customs broker to help avoid potentially costly errors. To find a licensed customs broker, start by searching the national customs agency where the import will take place, as they frequently list registered brokers that can be contacted.

:: Help Financial Instrument [Help] {"position":"1225,375","size":"100,100"}
(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[What are financial instruments in international trade?]\

''Letter of credit (LC):'' LCs are commonly used in international trade to mitigate the risk of non-payment and ensure a smooth transaction between the buyer and the seller. This is a financial instrument issued by a bank at the request of the importer or buyer, promising to pay the exporter or seller an agreed amount of money once the seller has met their contractual obligations. The LC serves as a guarantee to the seller that they will be paid without risk of the buyer witholding payment. It also provides the buyer with some protection against the seller's failure to deliver the goods or meet the terms of the agreement.

''Promissory note:'' A promissory note is another financial instrument commonly used in international trade. It is a direct contract between the buyer and seller, with the buyer (importer) agreeing to pay a specific amount of money to the seller (exporter) at a pre-determined time or on demand. The promissory note is a legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions of the payment, such as the interest rate, payment due date, and any penalties for late payment. Like a letter of credit, the exporter can use the promissory note as collateral to secure financing from banks or other financial institutions.

''Open account: ''This is a payment method where the buyer agrees to pay the seller after a set period of time, usually 30, 60, or 90 days after the goods have been shipped. Because of the risk of non-payment, this method is more common between established trading partners who have a good credit history with each other.

To determine how much extra financing you need, you should first create a budget that outlines all the costs associated with your international trade transaction, including production, transportation, insurance, and any customs or regulatory fees. It is important to consider any potential risks or unforeseen expenses that may arise during the transaction and factor those into your budget as well.

''Bank Loan''

You may find that you need additional financing to complete your export. One option is a bank loan. When getting a loan for your business, there are several important things to keep in mind:
0. ''Credit history: ''Your personal and business credit history will play a big role in whether you are approved for a loan and what terms you are offered.
0. ''Collateral: ''Depending on the type of loan, you may be required to provide collateral, such as real estate, inventory, or accounts receivable to secure the loan.
0. ''Interest rate and fees: ''Be sure to shop around and compare interest rates and fees from different lenders to get the best deal possible.
0. ''Repayment terms:'' Understand the terms of the loan, including the length of the loan, the repayment schedule, and any penalties for early payment.
0. ''Business plan: ''Having a solid business plan in place can demonstrate to lenders that you have a clear plan for using the funds and generating revenue to repay the loan, thus helping you to secure financing. 

''Customer Prepayment''

You may find that you need additional financing to complete your export. If this is the case, you may consider asking your customer(s) to prepay for products. Prepayment provides a level of security to the exporter, as it ensures that they will receive payment for the goods before they are shipped. However, prepayment can also be a potential obstacle to securing sales, as customers may be reluctant to pay upfront before they have received the goods. It is important for exporters to weigh the risks and benefits of prepayment before deciding on this option.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[How should I market my product?]\
Depending on what type of product you are selling and your potential customer type, you may opt for different marketing strategies. For example, if your product is consumer ready and you are selling directly to consumers, this is known as a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) transaction. If your product is an input to produce something else, you may be selling to another business. This is know as a Business-to-Business (B2B) transaction.  B2C sales often occur online and therefore you may opt for a digital marketing strategy to spread the word about your product. B2B sales are often initiated through referrals or as a result of an in-person interaction such as a trade fair.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Here are your options for your marketing strategy:]\
''Trade promotion agency (TPA):'' A TPA conducts export promotion activities by providing information, linkages, technical advice, marketing and policy advocacy for enterprises which can help you connect directly with customers faster. This is a good option for B2B transactions.

''E-commerce:'' E-commerce can promote online sales and help find more customers. You can use the  '' <a href="https://tools.ecomconnect.org/readiness/" target="_blank">e-commerce readiness assessment</a>'' tool to evaluate business capabilities to engage in e-commerce activities and sell online. But it can be costly to use a third-party platform.

''Business website:'' Having a website provides an online platform for businesses to showcase their products or services, communicate with customers, and establish their brand image. A well-designed and informative website can attract potential customers and provide them with important information such as product features, pricing, and shipping information.

:: Help Voluntary Standards [Help] {"position":"550,700","size":"100,100"}
(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[What are voluntary standards?]\

Voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) involve guidelines, rules and requirements aiming to foster sustainability along global value chains by ensuring businesses use resources and processes that do not damage the environment and people. Some examples may include organic, fair trade, or energy star.

While the adoption of VSS may incur costs, it can also lead to benefits in improving management and monitoring systems, productivity, and access to credit, which are relevant for expanding business operations and reaching new markets. 

Globally, adoption and implementation of VSS is varied. It is important to understand whether customers in your destination market have a preference for VSS before implementing.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Here is an overview of demand for VSS in different destination countries:]\
* ''Kujuma'' does not have a preference for voluntary sustainability standards as of yet. However, this does not mean that Kujuma disregards sustainability practices. As a responsible exporter, it is important to adhere to ethical and sustainable standards when conducting business in Kujuma, especially for companies that have a commitment to sustainability.
* ''Sarvahara'' has a low but growing demand for sustainability standards in international trade. While there are no regulations mandating sustainable practices for exports, some businesses are starting to take the initiative to adopt them voluntarily. 
* ''Luminaria'' has shown a preference for voluntary sustainable standards in recent years. Many businesses and consumers in Luminaria have become increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the products they use and purchase. As a result, there is a strong demand for products that meet certain sustainability criteria.
(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[What is sustainable packaging?]\
Sustainable packaging refers to packaging materials and methods that have minimal negative impact on the environment, and that are designed to be reused, recycled, or composted at the end of their life cycle. By using sustainable packaging, businesses can reduce their carbon footprint, minimize waste, and improve their environmental image, which can enhance their reputation and competitiveness in the global market. However, it is important to understand whether your market has a preference for such packaging before implementing.

Welcome to the Trade Game!

Exporting is a great way to grow your business by expanding your customer base beyond the domestic market. Just as in real life, the opportunities and challenges of international trade vary from region to region and between developed, developing and least developed countries.

In this game, you will encounter different products with different export markets based upon where you begin your journey. You may also face different challenges and receive different rewards depending on the choices you make throughout the game.

Throughout the game, you can find useful information, hints, and tips in the help section of each page. Look for the (background: #B30900)+(text-color:white)+(corner-radius:8)+(css:"padding: 0.2em;")[''Help''] button in the bottom right corner. 

The choice is yours. Where would you like to begin your export journey?

:: Second Feedback [Help] {"position":"1100,1425","size":"100,100"}
Your product is about to leave $ExportCountry to be sent to $ImportCountry! Here is some feedback on your responses so far.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Financial Instrument]\
For the financial instrument option, you selected: (if:$Contract is "Letter")[(text-colour:red)[''Letter of credit.'']
](if:$Contract is "Promissory")[(text-colour:red)[''Promissory note.
'']](if:$Contract is "Account")[(text-colour:red)[''Open account.''
]]\

Letter of credit is a good choice as it can mitigate the risk of non-payment and ensure a smooth transaction between the buyer and the seller.

Promissory note is a good choice since it provides a legal guarantee of payment by the buyer that can be enforced in the event of non-payment..

Open account agreements are risky because of their informal nature. It is advisable to use this arrangement only when you have an established and trusted relationship with your trading partner(s).

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Financing]\
For the financing option, you selected: (if:$Finance is "Loan")[(text-colour:red)[''Request a loan from a bank.'']
](if:$Finance is "Prepay")[(text-colour:red)[''Ask your customer to pre-pay.
'']](if:$Finance is "NoFinance")[(text-colour:red)[''Continue with current funding.''
]]\

A bank loan can be a good idea, but you need to consider interests rates and your ability to repay the loan. You should only select this option If you feel you need additional funding.

Asking for prepayment from customers can be a potential obstacle to securing sales, as customers may be reluctant to pay upfront before they have received the goods. You may choose this if you are unable to secure a bank loan but still think you may need additional funding to complete your export.

Continuing with current financing is fine as long as you have sufficient funds available. Unforeseen costs can arise at various points in your export journey.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Conveyance]\
For the shipping option, you selected: (if:$Conveyance is "Air")[(text-colour:red)[''Air Freight.'']
](if:$Conveyance is "Sea")[(text-colour:red)[''Sea Freight.
'']](if:$Conveyance is "Land")[(text-colour:red)[''Overland Transport.''
]]\

Sea freight is the most economical but slowest form of shipping. This selection is good if you are not time constrained. 

Overland transportation is a very flexible mode of transportation, and usual shipping times are in between sea and air freight times. However, it also carries increased risks and is only available for certain import-export country pairings. 

Air freight is the fastest, but also the most expensive form of transportation. This may be a good idea if you are short on time.

(align:"=><=")+(box:"=XXXX==")+(text-style:"bold")[Insurance]\
For the insurance option, you selected: (if:$Insurance is "Insurance")[(text-colour:red)[''Buy insurance.'']
](if:$Insurance is  "NoInsurance")[(text-colour:red)[''Decline insurance.
'']]\

Buying insurance can be very helpful to protect you since there there are many unknowns throughout the trade journey which may incur unforeseen costs.
